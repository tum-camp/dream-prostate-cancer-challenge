def concordance_index_censored(event_indicator, event_time, estimate):
    """Concordance index for right-censored data

    The concordance index is defined as the proportion of all comparable pairs
    in which the predictions and outcomes are concordant.

    Samples are comparable if for at least one of them an event occurred.
    If the estimated risk is larger for the sample with a higher time of
    event/censoring, the predictions of that pair are said to be concordant.
    If an event occurred for one sample and the other is known to be
    event-free at least until the time of event of the first, the second
    sample is assumed to *outlive* the first.
    When predicted risks are identical for a pair, 0.5 rather than 1 is added
    to the count of concordant pairs.
    A pair is not comparable if an event occurred for both of them at the same
    time or an event occurred for one of them but the time of censoring is
    smaller than the time of event of the first one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_indicator : array-like, shape = [n_samples,]
        Boolean array denotes whether an event occurred

    event_time : array-like, shape = [n_samples,]
        Array containing the time of an event or time of censoring

    estimate : array-like, shape = [n_samples,]
        Estimated risk of experiencing an event

    Returns
    -------
    cindex : float
        Concordance index

    concordant : int
        Number of concordant pairs

    discordant : int
        Number of discordant pairs

    tied_risk : int
        Number of pairs having tied estimated risks

    tied_time : int
        Number of pairs having an event at the same time
